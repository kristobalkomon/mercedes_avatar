               <p class="section__text">Mercedes-Benz introduced the Vision AVTR concept: the electric prototype has a
                  range of up to 700 kilometers and was inspired by the movie Avatar. Mercedes-Benz presented the Vision
                  AVTR (Advanced Vehicle Transformation) concept at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), an event
                  currently
                  taking place in Las Vegas, USA. According to German manufacturer officials, the prototype was inspired
                  by
                  the movie Avatar.</p>

                  <p class="section__text">When a real-life car takes inspiration from a far-out fantasy film like
                     Avatar,
                     you know it’s going to be wild. Mercedes-Benz certainly didn’t disappoint in that regard with
                     VISION
                     AVTR, a new concept vehicle that not only looks like it time traveled here from the future, but
                     also
                     runs on vehicle systems controlled by the driver’s mind.</p>
                  <p class="section__text">Powered by four individually controllable electric motors with all-wheel
                     drive,
                     the car can move 30 degrees sideways through “crab movement,” thanks to the ability to drive the
                     front
                     and rear axles simultaneously or in opposite directions. A central control pad is used in place of
                     pedals, and the steering wheel vibrates and pulsates like a living creature.</p>
                  <p class="section__text">All of these things are pretty out there, but let’s start with what’s got to
                     be
                     the weirdest feature. A brain-computer interface (BCI) device attaches to the driver’s head with a
                     headband and measures brain waves to trigger functions like operating the radio, interior lights,
                     and
                     navigation destinations. The idea is to avoid being distracted by these functions while using the
                     “intuitive control” console unit to drive the car. The look of the VISION AVTR is vaguely
                     reptilian,
                     its rear end covered in 33 scales that can move individually. Referred to as “bionic flaps,” they
                     open, close, ripple, and change colors according to the car’s movements.</p>

                  <p class="section__text section__text-top">The VISION AVTR creates physical sensations in the console
                     unit to mimic “energy flows” that transmit the feeling of wind resistance while driving in various
                     directions. The console also recognizes the driver by their breathing patterns to personalize the
                     driving experience. In place of a dashboard is a giant curved display module projecting real-time
                     footage of the road and surrounding environment, along with optional 3D graphics of Pandora, the
                     fictional setting of the movie Avatar.</p>

                  <p class="section__text">Each wheel is powered by its own electric motor, and together they produce an
                     impressive 469 horsepower. The car’s battery gives it a driving range of up to 435 miles and fully
                     charges in just 15 minutes. While most electric cars have batteries made from toxic and unethically
                     mined materials like cobalt and lithium, the VISION AVTR’s organic cell battery is made of
                     graphene, so it’s theoretically recyclable via composting.</p>
                  <p class="section__text design__text">“When the boundaries between vehicle and living beings are
                     lifted, Mercedes-Benz combines luxury and sustainability and works to make the vehicles as
                     resource-saving as possible,” reads the company’s website. “With the VISION AVTR, the brand is now
                     showing how a vehicle can blend harmoniously into its environment and communicate with it. In the
                     ecosystem of the future, the ultimate luxury is the fusion of human and nature with the help of
                     technology. The VISION AVTR is thus an example of sustainable luxury in the field of design. As
                     soon as you get in, the car becomes an extension of your own body and a tool to discover the
                     environment, much as in the film humans can use avatars to extend and expand their abilities.”</p>

                     ever become a reality, but they do represent some sustainable and forward-thinking goals for the
                     automotive industry to move toward.</p>

               <p class="section__text">MORE PAWS THAN WHEELS — In the video, Gorden Wagener, chief design officier for
                  the Daimler Group, explains that the ATVR doesn't so much have wheels as it does "animal paws." The
                  paw-and-flower-inspired wheels enable the vehicles to "crab walk" at 30 degrees, which would likely be
                  a boon for parking in tight, parallel spaces.</p>
               <p class="section__text">Instead of a steering wheel, there's a central control pad that the driver (or
                  passenger) can rest their hand on and move left or right, backwards or forwards, to pilot the car,
                  should they wish to... but the idea is that the car will be primarily autonomous.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="design__desc-column">
               <p class="section__text">A CAR THAT TALKS TO YOU — Vera Schmidt, director of advanced user experience
                  design, says with the AVTR the idea is to make it an extension of the owner rather than merely being
                  an object beholden to human commands. There's no steering wheel, no display buttons, and no touch
                  screens. All interactions are controlled with gestures or the via central control unit (which for
                  extra, biologically-inspired strangeness, pulses like a heartbeat), and the interface's confirmations
                  include full-surface (rather than full-screen) projections on the interior.</p>
               <p class="section__text">The exterior is devoid of any sharp corners, and there are translucent panels in
                  lieu of conventional doors, so if you ever get to drive one you're going to want to wear pants which,
                  granted, is probably good advice whatever you're driving. It's the motoring equivalent of wearing
                  closed shoes when riding an e-scooter, really.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="design__desc-column">
               <p class="section__text">FLAPS THAT "TALK" — 33 flaps on the rear of the vehicle affect the
                  aerodynamics and "communicate" with other drivers (they change angle and color to indicate
                  accelerating, turning or braking). Like the rest of the lighting on and in the AVTR Vision the
                  flaps are AI-powered, which Mercedes says allows the car to "express emotions." That's some
                  ludicrous marketing speak if ever we've heard it, but we can't deny we're enthralled by the vehicle
                  nonetheless.</p>
               <p class="section__text">Whether we'll ever actually see the AVTR on an actual road (rather than a
                  closed, private one resembling a runway) remains to be seen, but Mercedes-Benz is certainly playing
                  the hype-building marketing game right.</p>
